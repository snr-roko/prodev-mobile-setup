# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Steps Followed for Scaffolding

1. Ran `mkdir prodev-mobile-app-0x00`.
2. Ran `cd prodev-mobile-app-0x00`.
3. Ran `npx create-expo-app .` to scaffold a new Expo project.
3. Installed dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Verified the project runs with `npx expo start`.

## Observations from `reset-project` Command

- Running `npm run reset-project` moved the original starter code into the `app-example` directory.
- The `app` directory was replaced with a blank template, ready for new development.
- Project configuration files and dependencies remained unchanged.
- This command is useful for starting fresh while keeping a reference to the original example code.
